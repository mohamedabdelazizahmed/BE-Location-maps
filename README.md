# Backend Task: Implementing Locations API

## Overview

Develop a RESTful API with Node.js, ECMAScript 6, Sequelize ORM, and PostgreSQL to manage locations.
Implement three endpoints:
/api/v1/create (POST): Create a new location.
/api/v1/upload (POST): Upload an image and return the path.
/api/v1/locations (GET): Retrieve all locations.
Utilize a simple MVC structure for organization.
## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm installed
PostgreSQL database set up
Understanding of Node.js, JavaScript, and RESTful APIs
Basic knowledge of Sequelize ORM
## Steps

Set up project:

Create a new Node.js project directory.
Initialize a package.json file: npm init -y
Install required dependencies:
Bash
npm install express sequelize pg pg-hstore cors body-parser multer

Configure Sequelize:

Create a models directory to define model files.
Create a config directory to store database configuration.
Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database in a config/database.js file.
Define the Location model in a models/Location.js file, including title, longitude, latitude, and image fields.
Implement controllers:

Create a controllers directory to house controller files.
Implement the following controllers:
controllers/createLocationController.js: handles /api/v1/create endpoint, creating new locations.
controllers/uploadImageController.js: handles /api/v1/upload endpoint, processing image uploads.
controllers/getLocationsController.js: handles /api/v1/locations endpoint, fetching all locations.
Set up routes:

Create a routes directory for route definitions.
Define routes in a routes/api.js file, associating endpoints with their respective controllers.
Configure server:

Create a server.js file to initiate the Express server.
Import necessary modules, configure middleware (e.g., CORS, body-parser, Multer), and set up routes.
Run the application:

Start the server using node server.js.
## Additional considerations

Implement error handling and input validation.
Consider security measures like authentication and authorization.
Write comprehensive tests to ensure API functionality.
Explore techniques for image optimization and storage.
